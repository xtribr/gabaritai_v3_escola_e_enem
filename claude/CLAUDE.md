## Git Workflow
- Do not include "Claude Code" in commit messages
- Use conventional commits (be brief and descriptive)

## Important Concepts
Focus on these principles in all code:
- e2e type-safety
- error monitoring/observability
- automated tests
- readability/maintainability

All detailed coding guidelines are in the skills:
- Use `software-engineering` skill for core principles
- Use `typescript` skill for TypeScript/JavaScript standards
- Use `react` skill for React/Next.js best practices
- Use `reviewing-code` skill for code reviews
- Use `writing` skill for documentation and commit messages
